## Some information : 
1. We used BERT free education transformer
2. We used streamlit for UI
3. The Application can accept ( PDF , DOCX, normal text ) to work on it
4. The greater the amount of texts, the greater the load on this version of the model, so the amount of time required for the answer increases
5. The efficiency of the model can be increased if a higher virginity is used
6. Requirements.txt file contains the libraries that must be present
